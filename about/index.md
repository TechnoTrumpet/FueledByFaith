## About Me

I'm Ryan, 18 years old, born again on October 20th, 2017. While I love my hometown of New Bethlehem, I'm currently residing in Rochester, New York while I attend the Rochester Institute of Technology for Computing Security. Despite being a computing major, I'm still pretty bad at coding (just hang with me while the website develops!) but always love a challenge. This is currently the second version of Fueled by Faith, and the original can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/mooer112233/ARCHIVED-Fueled-by-Faith). Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions via the information below!

## Contact Me

I'd love to hear from you! If you have an article idea, bug report, or just want to say hi, all of the social links on the homepage/menu bar are excellent ways to get ahold of me! If, however, you want to send an email the old-fashioned way, feel free to reach out at [fueledbyfaithblogs@gmail.com](mailto:fueledbyfaithblogs@gmail.com). You can also check out my [personal website](http://ryanwmoore.me) for more contact information/social profiles.
